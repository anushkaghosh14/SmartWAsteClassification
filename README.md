# SmartWAsteClassification
This project is an AI-powered smart waste segregation system that classifies waste as biodegradable or non-biodegradable using computer vision and deep learning. It integrates machine learning (MobileNetV2) for classification, OpenCV for real-time image capture, and Arduino for LED indication.
